send Halley the calculation from which he had calculated the answer.", "In 1703, he was elected President of the Royal Society, an office he held until his death.", "He also was fascinated by the mechanics of Copernican astronomy as set out by Galileo and by Kepler's \"Optics\".", "Now obliged to deliver an annual course of lectures, Newton chose optics as his first subject.", "Newton influenced Cheselden, Dalton, De Moivre, Maupertius, Buffon, Winthrop, Hales, Pieter van Musschenbroek and Whiston.", "He also said he thought light consisted of the motion of small particles, rather than waves.", "Passing a beam of sunlight through a prism, he observed that the beam spread into a colored band of light (spectrum), and from this he argued that sunlight is really a combination of all the colors.", "He assumed that the rate of fall is proportional to the force of gravity and that this force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth.", "Over the next three years he summarized his findings in an essay, \"Of Colours\", which  became Book One of his \"Opticks\",  published in 1704.", "In 1689, Newton campaigned for a seat in Parliament and became Member for Cambridge.", "In the summer of 1684, Halley visited Newton at Cambridge to discuss orbital dynamics.", "It was acknowledged that though Leibniz's discoveries were later in time, he preceded Newton in publishing a full account.", "From 1664, he recorded his thoughts in a notebook he called \"Certain Philosophical Questions\".", "\"Principia\" was translated into French by du Chatelet in 1759.", "However, in 1692, the strain of his studies and his scientific disputes, especially with Leibniz, Flamsteed and Hooke, cast him into a severe depression and rumors spread that he had gone mad.", "Soon after, he also found the missing link in the identification of the force of terrestrial gravity by discovering that a spherically-symmetrical distribution of matter exerts the same attraction at external points as if its mass were concentrated at its center.", "His theory of gravity was particularly important in working out the motions of the planets.", "Three months later, Halley received a short tract, (\"On Motion\") which at Halley's request was registered with the Royal Society in early 1685.", "His laws of motion laid the basis for classical mechanics.", "Late in 1679, Hooke wrote to Newton describing his analysis of planetary motion.", "In 1675, when Newton published another paper on the color phenomena in thin films, he annoyed Hooke again, this time because Hooke thought Newton had stolen some of his own optical results.", "The physicist Brewster wrote his biography.", "His work related to that of Algarotti, Gregory, Stevin,  'sGravesende  Haukesbee, Wallis, Johann Bernoulli, Stevin, Cavendish, Ferrel, Copernicus, Peiresc and William of Ockham.", "In 1696, he was appointed Warden of the London Mint, becoming Master of the Mint in 1699.", "By their application, Newton formulated the universal laws of nature with which he was able to solve virtually all the unsolved problems of his day.", "He wondered whether the force that pulled an apple to the ground could also pull the Moon into an orbit around the Earth.", "The idea of a law of attraction according to the inverse square of the distance between the sun and the planets was now a topic of wide discussion in scientific circles.", "In this paper, Newton demonstrated the existence of periodic optical phenomena: he had discovered concentric colored rings in the thin film of air between a lens and a flat sheet of glass and calculated that the distance between these concentric rings (\"Newton's rings\") depended on the thickness of the film of air.", "Voltaire remarked that England had honored a mathematician as other nations had honored a king.", "He admired the work of Oughtred.", "Newton knew or worked with Tillotson, Sprat, Leeuwenhoek, Grew, Sloane and Arbuthnot.", "Newton turned his attention to the nature of light.", "Newton was given a state funeral and was buried in Westminster Abbey.", "Both objected to Newton's attempt to prove by experiment alone that light consisted of the motion of small particles.", "While in London, he met famous diarists Evelyn and Pepys and philosopher Locke .", "He met Romer.", "Between 1665 and 1667, Newton made revolutionary advances in optics, physics, and astronomy, and laid the foundations for differential and integral calculus, several years before Leibniz's  discoveries.", "With Halley's help, the \"Principia\" was published in 1687 and hailed as a masterpiece.", "This led to an exchange between the two on the subject of elliptical orbits.", "The \"method of fluxions\", as he called it,  produced simple analytical methods that unified many existing techniques so as to solve problems like finding areas, tangents, the lengths of curves, and the maximums and minimums of functions.", "In 1669, Barrow decided the world must know about Newton's mathematical achievements and sent Newton's preliminary work, \"On Analysis by Infinite Series,\"  to John Collins in London.", "The inverse problem of calculating the orbit from the law of force (which had baffled Hooke, Wren , Halley and others) was solved by Newton around 1680.", "This tract, which over the next two years Newton expanded, formed the basis of the first book of \"Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica\" (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\") or the \"Principia\", as it commonly known.", "A Royal Society panel, including Halley and mathematician William Jones ,  decided that Newton was the first to unify and make explicit what had been latent in the work of various forerunners.", "He studied higher mathematics under Professor Isaac Barrow , who recognized Newton's genius and encouraged him.", "One of the greatest scientists of all time.", "His gravitational law declared that the force of gravity is proportional to the masses of the objects and decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between two bodies.", "During his third year at Cambridge, Newton went beyond the compulsory study of Aristotle and read the works of Descartes , Gassendi , Hobbes , and 17th-century chemist Boyle .", "The paper provoked skepticism from the curator of the Royal Society, Hooke , and, on the Continent, from Christiaan Huyghens .", "In 1672, Newton published an account of his findings on white light in the Royal Society's \"Philosophical Transactions\".", "Contemporary scientists believed that white light was a basic single entity, but the chromatic aberration seen in a telescope lens convinced Newton otherwise.", "A constant preoccupation for Newton was the continuing fight with Leibniz over who first invented calculus.", "Barrow then resigned his Lucasian Professor's chair to make way for Newton.", "In the simple case of circular orbit, the law of attraction followed from Kepler's Third Law (relating the times of revolution of the planets around the sun to the sizes of their orbits) together with Huyghens's 1673 expression for the centripetal acceleration of a body moving in a circle.", "In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne.", "Disappointed, he set aside his figures and did not return to them until about 12 years later.", "The \"Principia\" contained Newton's three laws of motion (now known as Newton's Laws: laws of inertia, action and reaction, and acceleration proportional to force),  his theory of tides and lunar motion,  and his theory of gravitation as a universal law of attraction between any two objects.", "Also at this time, Newton began to think about gravity.", "He then worked out what the motion of the Moon would be if these assumptions

property lines and supervising the massive rebuilding work.", "'Micrographia' included Hooke's studies and illustrations of the crystal structure of snowflakes, discussed the possibility of making artificial fibres by a process similar to the spinning of the silkworm and examined the honeycomb structure of cork, coining the modern biological term 'cell'.", "He suggested the freezing point of water as the zero point on the thermometer, then developed an instrument to calibrate the temperature, invented a weather clock, which recorded barometric pressure, temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind velocity on a rotating drum.", "He then replacing the pendulum, first proposed as a timing device by Mersenne, with a vibrating wheel that could be moved, because it oscillated around its own

Griffith.", "His first course of lectures were on galvanism, after which he was commissioned to conduct an investigation into the process of tanning.", "He discovered that the gas did not penetrate through very small openings and worked out the exact size of aperture which stopped the gas.", "Davy examined the substance in his portable laboratory at his Paris hotel, named it iodine and published an account of its properties, greatly offending Gay-Lussac.", "In addition to his own experiments he visited tanneries and listened to the opinions of those in the business.", "He then proceeded to isolate the alkaline-earth metals (following a method described to him in a letter from the Swedish scientist Berzelius) and also to discover boron, hydrogen telluride and hydrogen phosphide.", "Soon

therefore Davy who made the connection between voltaic electricity and chemistry, a process known as electrolysis.", "In 1807 he was awarded the Napoleon prize by the Institut de France for his work on electrolysis, in spite of the fact that England and France were at war.", "The lamp went out in explosive mixtures in which the fire-damp was in sufficient quantities to absorb the whole oxygen of

when there was a danger of explosion, so they also acted as detectors.", "On his return he was asked by the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines to conduct research into a safer way of lighting mines.", "For his invention, Davy was awarded medals by the Royal Society and given a service of plate by the northern mine owners.", "He also made observations on Vesuvius.", "He was wounded

Yugoslavia, the island of Crete and Cyrenaica.", "Soon a million Allied troops were driving the German allies eastwards, while the Soviets came from the opposite direction.", "The mid-1920s saw a period of economic stability in Germany, and while in January 1925 the ban on the party was removed in Bavaria, allowing Hitler to speak in public, elsewhere prohibitions remained in force until

like the nationalist and racist German Workers' Party (DAP), which Hitler joined in September 1919.", "On his release, Hitler began to rebuild the Nazi Party, which had disintegrated in his absence,

bohemian existence, making a precarious living selling paintings and drawings of Vienna and producing posters and advertisements for small traders.", "From his experiences, Hitler had now learned that the road to power lay not through force alone, but through legal subversion of the Weimar Constitution, and he set out to build a mass movement empowered by a combination of parliamentary strength and extra-parliamentary street terror and intimidation.", "He then spent four years at the Linz Realschule, followed by a period at a boarding school in Steyr.", "A day later, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and Hitler declared war on the United States, although the German pact with Japan was purely defensive and he had not been informed of Japanese intentions.", "From these Hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his Socialist and Communist opponents.", "His 'Third Reich', which was to have endured forever, ended after twelve years of unparalleled brutality, in which 30 million people lost their lives, twelve million of them far from the battlefields:  by mass shootings, in forced labour camps and in the gas ovens of Belsen, Dachau, Auschwitz, Ravensbruck and other concentration camps in accordance with Nazi racial theories.", "Had political connection with Benes.", "At the same time, Hitler gathered around him several of

hospital in Pomerania   During the war Hitler had found comradeship, discipline, and participation in conflict intensely satisfying, and in November 1918 learned with horror of Germany's defeat,  and of the humiliation of the armistice arranged  by the 'big three':  Lloyd George (UK) , Clemenceau (France) and Woodrow Wilson (US).", "In March 1938, he forced Austria into 'Anschluss' (political union) with Germany, making a triumphantal entry into Vienna.", "As the Red Army approached Berlin and the Anglo-Americans reached the Elbe, on 19 March Hitler ordered the destruction of what remained
